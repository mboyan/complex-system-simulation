## Artificial Life :bug:

Finding algorithms which mimic living organisms can yield insights about universal principles governing what we define as life.
Theory points to the hypothesis that life emerges at a phase transition, at the boundary between order and chaos.
Apparently, so does computation. We can therefore explore intersections between these two notions, either in the possibilities to simulate living creatures or in the prospect of living systems performing computation.
Furthermore, Artificial Life can have practical application in domains like soft robotics.

Below is some research based on multi-neighbourhood, smooth Cellular Automata producing interesting self-replicating formations:

## Growth Patterns ‚ùÑÔ∏è

Growth processes are relevant for understanding biological and physical phenomena, but their principles can also be transferred to generative design
(e.g. to produce formations with specific surface area to volume ratio) or to model phenomena on entirely different scales (e.g. cities).
The following papers describe growth processes mostly based on the spatial aggregation of diffuse particles.

## Modelling Sand Dune Formation üèñÔ∏è

This is a fairly straightforward method to apply CA to modelling the formation of Aeolian Dunes and possibly some other geological processes.

## Ecosystems: Adaptation and Extinction üêù

This topic could go in different directions. How does evolution and adaptation occur with regards to Self-Organized Criticality?
How can we identify patterns that foreshadow the extinction of a species or another kind of bifurcation in an ecosystem?

Emergence of Criticality in Living Systems: https://github.com/mboyan/complex-system-simulation/blob/main/Project/Inspiration/hidalgo-et-al-2014-information-based-fitness-and-the-emergence-of-criticality-in-living-systems.pdf
