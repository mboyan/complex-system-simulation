# Catching the Drift:<br/>Modelling Coral Growth with Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA)
## _Course Project in Complex System Simulation, MSc Computational Science (UvA/VU)_

This repository contains the simulation framework constructed during a two-week university project for the course Complex System Simulation in January 2024.
The object of our research is using Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA)<sup>10</sup> to model coral growth.

### Introduction
[Corals](https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2019.00143) are colonial marine organisms of great environmental importance.
Understanding their behaviour, morphogenesis and lifecycle are essential for their preservation.
It has been recognised<sup>2</sup> that their growth can be modelled using DLA - an algorithm which generates branching clusters that can closely mimic various natural phenomena, from urban structures<sup>9</sup> to fluid interface instabilities<sup>7</sup>.

The building blocks of corals are polyps - small tentacled invertebrates which live in a symbiotic relationship with photosynthesising algae called zooxanthellae.
The algae hosted in their tissues absorb sunlight to produce most of the energy required for the coral to survive.
The rest is acquired by the polyps by capturing and digesting nutrients carried by the underwater currents, which can range from zooplankton to small fish.
Throughout their lifecycle, corals excrete calcium carbonate, which becomes the main component in coral reefs.
