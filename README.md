# Catching the Drift:<br/>Modelling Coral Growth with Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA)
## _Course Project in Complex System Simulation, MSc Computational Science (UvA/VU)_

This repository contains the simulation framework constructed during a two-week university project for the course Complex System Simulation in January 2024.
The object of our research is using Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA)<sup><a href="8">8</a></sup> to model coral growth.

### Introduction
[Corals](https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2019.00143) are colonial marine organisms of great environmental importance.
Understanding their behaviour, morphogenesis and lifecycle are essential for their preservation.
It has been recognised that their growth can be modelled using DLA
